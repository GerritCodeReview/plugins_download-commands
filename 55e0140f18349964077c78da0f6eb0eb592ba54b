      "message": "According to my local test, the hooks directory exists even if removing this command. Also, the command provisions for a potentially missing .git parent directory (through -p), which doesn\u0027t happen, as .git always exists.\n\nIs the goal of this change simply to make the provisioning of .git/hooks explicit in this code? If so, how about adding that information to the commit message? Otherwise, under which circumstances was a missing .git/hooks directory structure noticed? (Would document this further as well.)",
