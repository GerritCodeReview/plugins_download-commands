To me it seems like `gerrit:tools/bzl/junit.bzl` was updated more recently.\nThere\u0027s still a dependency to \"in-tree\" `tools/bzl:plugin.bzl` that isn\u0027t available in bazlets (AFAICT).",

      "message": "I should have set a topic.\nI am currently working on the Gerrit build. Mostly on the transition to use bazel modules. As part of that, I had to also introduce the bazel module for bazlets to make plugin standalone builds work. While doing that, I noticed, that we have a lot of bazel scripts/rules that are mostly duplicated between Gerrit and bazlets. This does not work well for maintenance. It makes much more sense to have those scripts/rules once in a bazel library and reuse them everywhere. That is what I started working on. While doing that, I create changes in bazlets that updates the rules to the state in Gerrit, which is usually more up-to-date.",
