The reason for changing this is that the \"/a\" for authentication was wrongfully being removed from the url when using the option of cloning with the commit message hook. Even if consistency is a reason to change this (both url are the same no matter if you are cloning with or without a commit message hook), the main one is that when removing the authentication cloning was failing in our test server because of a validation plugin that we have not receiving an authenticated user.",
