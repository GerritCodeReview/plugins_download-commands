      "message": "This is true, the base64 and zip options for downloading the patch are still hard-coded in Gerrit. We can consider to make them configurable and to move them into the this plugin as well. But this I would leave for later, it\u0027s already difficult enough to split off the other download commands and I would like to move forward with smallest possible steps which provide some value.",
