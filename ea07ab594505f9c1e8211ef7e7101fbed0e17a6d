      "message": "Hmm, how about adding an early check for the placeholder case instead? Like this after line 88 at the beginning of the method:\n\nif (project.startsWith(\u0027$\u0027) || ref.startsWith(\u0027$\u0027)) {\n  // No real value but placeholders are being used.\n  return ref;\n}\n\nAnd in exchange remove this code as well as the one starting at line 104. And I would keep the log.error() from the previous patch set here.",
